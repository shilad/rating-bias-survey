        		<p><b>You are invited to be in a research study exploring how the effectiveness of rating metrics that attempt to separate objectivity and subjectivity in article ratings. We ask that you read this form and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to be in the study.</b></p>
				<p>This study is being conducted by Emmy Lim, at Macalester College.</p>

        		<h2>Background Information</h2>
        		<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate subjectivity in quality ratings of articles. That is, whether the presence of a strictly subjective rating affects a rater’s ability to rate objectively, or whether a rater’s bias affect their rating. Doing so will allow for the creation of more effective and reliable rating metrics.</p>
        	</section>
        	<section>
        		<h2>Procedures:</h2>
				<p>If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to rate a minimum of 5 wikipedia pages on a variety of topics using a rating widget on the left side of the page. You will be asked to provide your email and be given a brief introduction to navigating the survey beforehand. After rating 5 pages, you may simply discontinue, or you may continue rating articles to further help the study.</p>
